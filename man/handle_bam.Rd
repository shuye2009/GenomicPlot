\usage{
handle_bam(inputFile, handleInputParams = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputFile}{a string denoting path to the input file}

\item{handleInputParams}{a list of parameters for \code{handle_input}}
}
\value{
a list object with four elements, 'query' is a list GRanges objects or RleList objects, 'size' is the library size, 'type' is the input file type, weight' is the name of the metadata column to be used as weight for coverage calculation
}
\description{
This is a function for read NGS reads data in bam format, store the input data in a list of GRanges objects or RleList objects. For paired-end reads, only take the second read in a pair, assuming which is the sense read for strand-specific RNAseq.
}
\details{
The reads are filtered using mapq score >= 10 by default, only mapped reads are counted towards library size.
