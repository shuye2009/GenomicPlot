\description{
Replace 0 and missing values in a sparse non-negative matrix with half of median of column means, to avoid use of arbitrary pseudo numbers, and to allow computing ratios and log transformation of matrices. When a matrix is sparse (assuming it has many all-zero rows and few all-zero columns), the half of median of column means is a number that is small enough so that is will not distort the data too much (comparing to pseudo count=1), but large enough to avoid huge ratios when used as a denominator.
