\title{Plot two-sets Venn diagram}
\usage{
overlap_pair(apair, overlap_fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{apair}{a list of two vectors}

\item{overlap_fun}{the name of the function that defines overlap, depending on the type of object in the vectors. For GRanges, use filter_by_overlaps_stranded or filter_by_overlaps_nonstranded, for gene names, use intersect.}
}
\value{
a VennDiagram object
}
\description{
This is a helper function for Venn diagram plot. A Venn diagram is plotted as output. For GRanges, as A overlap B may not be the same as B overlap A, the order of GRanges in a list matters, certain order may produce error.
}
\examples{
test_list <- list(A = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), B = c(4, 5, 7))
overlap_pair(test_list, intersect)

## GRanges overlap
query <- GRanges("chr19", 
  IRanges(rep(c(10, 15), 2), width=c(1, 20, 40, 50)), 
  strand=c("+", "+", "-", "-")
)

subject <- GRanges("chr19", 
  IRanges(rep(c(13, 150), 2), width=c(10, 14, 20, 28)), 
  strand=c("+", "-", "-", "+")
)

overlap_pair(list(query = query, subject = subject), filter_by_overlaps_stranded)

## the following will generate an error
\donttest{
short <- GRanges("chr19", 
  IRanges(rep(c(10, 15), 1), width=c(10, 20)), 
  strand=c("+", "+")
)

long <- GRanges("chr19", 
  IRanges(rep(c(11, 15, 10), 1), width=c(10, 20, 10)), 
  strand=c("+", "+", "+")
)

#overlap_pair(list(query = long, subject = short), filter_by_overlaps_stranded)
}
