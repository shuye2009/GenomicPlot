\title{Plot Venn diagrams depicting overlap of gene lists}
\usage{
plot_overlap_genes(
  fileList,

  hw = c(8, 8),
  outPrefix = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fileList, }{a named list of tab-delimited files}

\item{columnList}{a vector of integers denoting the columns that have gene names in the list of files}

\item{pairOnly, }{logical, indicating whether only pair-wise overlap is desirable}

\item{hw}{a vector of two elements specifying the height and width of the output figures}

\item{outPrefix, }{a string for plot file name}
}
\value{
a list of vectors of gene names
}
\description{
This function takes a list of (at most 4) tab-delimited file names, and produce a Venn diagram
