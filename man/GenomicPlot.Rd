\description{
An R package for efficient and flexible visualization of NGS 
coverage profiles
}
\details{
The goal of `GenomicPlot` is to provide an efficient visualization
tool for next generation sequencing (NGS) data with rich functionality and
flexibility. `GenomicPlot` enables plotting of NGS data in various formats 
(bam, bed, wig and bigwig); both coverage and enrichment over input can be
computed and displayed with respect to genomic features (such as UTR, CDS, 
enhancer), and user defined genomic loci or regions. Statistical tests on 
signal intensity within user defined regions of interest can be performed 
and presented as box plots or pie charts. Parallel processing is enabled to 
speed up computation on multi-core platforms. Main functions are as follows:
\itemize{
 \item   \code{\link{plot_5parts_metagene}} generates genomic (with introns) 
     or metagenomic (without introns) plots around gene body and its upstream 
     and downstream regions, the gene body can be further segmented into 
     5'UTR, CDS and 3'UTR.
 \item   \code{\link{plot_start_end}} plots genomic profiles around the start 
     and end of genomic features (like exons or introns), or user defined 
     genomic regions. A center region with user defined width can be plotted 
     simultaneously.
 \item   \code{\link{plot_locus}} plots distance between sample peaks and 
     genomic features, or distance from one set of peaks to another set of 
     peaks. 
 \item   \code{\link{plot_region}} plots signal profiles within and around 
     genomic features, or user defined genomic regions.
 \item   \code{\link{plot_peak_annotation}} plots peak annotation statistics 
     (distribution in different type of genes, and in different parts of 
     genes).
 \item   \code{\link{plot_overlap_bed}} plots peak overlaps as Venn diagrams.
 \item   Random features can be generated and plotted to serve as contrast to 
     real features in \code{plot_locus_with_random} and 
     \code{\link{plot_start_end_with_random}}.
 \item   All profile line plots have error bands.
 \item   Statistical analysis results on user defined regions of interest are 
     plotted along with the profile plots in \code{\link{plot_region}}, 
     \code{\link{plot_locus}} and \code{\link{plot_locus_with_random}}.
