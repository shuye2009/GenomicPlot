\title{Extract the longest transcript for each protein-coding genes}
\usage{
extract_longest_tx(txdb, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{txdb}{a TxDb object defined in the GenomicFeatures package}

\item{plot}{logical, indicating whether feature length plots should be generated}
}
\value{
a dataframe of transcript information with the following columns: "tx_id tx_name
gene_id nexon tx_len cds_len utr5_len utr3_len"
}
\description{
Gene level computations require selecting one transcript per gene to avoid bias by genes with multiple
isoforms. In ideal case, the most abundant transcript (principal or canonical isoform) should be chosen. However, the
most abundant isoform may vary depending on tissue type or physiological condition, the longest transcript is usually
the principal isoform, and alternatively spliced isoforms are not. This method get the longest transcript for each
gene. The longest transcript is defined as the isoform that has the longest transcript length. In case of tie, the one
with longer CDS is selected. If the lengths of CDS tie again, the transcript with smaller id is selected arbitrarily.
