\title{Plot barplot for mean with standard error bars}
\usage{
draw_mean_se_barplot(
  stat_df,
  xc = "Feature",
  yc = "Intensity",
  fc = xc,
  comp = list(c(1, 2)),
  Xlab = xc,
  Ylab = yc,
  Ylim = NULL,
  nf = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stat_df}{a dataframe with column names c(xc, yc)}

\item{xc}{a string denoting column name for grouping}

\item{yc}{a string denoting column name for numeric data to be plotted}

\item{fc}{a string denoting column name for sub-grouping based on an additional factor}

\item{comp}{a list of vectors denoting pair-wise comparisons to be performed between groups}

\item{Xlab}{a string for x-axis label}

\item{Ylab}{a string for y-axis label}

\item{Ylim}{a numeric vector of two elements, defining custom limits of y-axis}

\item{nf}{a integer normalizing factor for correct count of observations when the data table has two factors, such as those produced by pivot_longer, equals to the number of factors}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
}
\description{
Plot barplot for mean with standard error bars, no p-value significance levels are displayed, but ANOVA p-value is provided as tag and TukeyHSD test are displayed as caption.

\examples{
stat_df <- data.frame(
  Feature = rep(c("A", "B"), c(20, 30)),
  Intensity = c(rnorm(20, 2), rnorm(30, 3))
)
p <- draw_mean_se_barplot(stat_df, xc = "Feature", yc = "Intensity", 
   Ylab = "Intensity")
