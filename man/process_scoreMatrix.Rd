\title{Preprocess scoreMatrix before plotting}
\usage{
process_scoreMatrix(
  fullmatrix,
  scale = FALSE,
  rmOutlier = 0,
  transform = NA,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fullmatrix}{a numeric matrix, with bins in columns and genomic windows in rows}

\item{scale}{logical, indicating whether the score matrix should be scaled to the range 0:1, so that samples with different baseline can be compared}

\item{rmOutlier}{logical, indicating whether a row with abnormally high values in the score matrix should be removed}

\item{transform}{a string in c("log", "log2", "log10"), default = NA indicating no transformation of data matrix}

\item{verbose}{logical, indicating whether to output additional information (data used for plotting or statistical test results)}
}
\value{
a numeric matrix with the same dimension as the fullmatrix
}
\description{
This is a helper function for manipulate the score matrix produced by ScoreMatrix or ScoreMatrinBin functions defined in the 'genomation' package. To facilitate downstream analysis, imputation of missing values is performed implicitly.
}
\details{
If inputFiles is null, all operations (impute, scale, rmOutlier and transform) can be applied to the score matrix, in the order of impute -> rmOutlier -> transform -> scale. When inputFiles are provided, only impute and rmOutlier can be applied to the score matrix, and transform and scale will affect ratio calculation, especially when log2 of ratio is intended, however, all these operations can be applied to the resulting ratio matrix. In order to avoid introducing distortion into the post-processed data, use caution when applying these operations.
