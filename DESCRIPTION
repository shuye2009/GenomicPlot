Description: Visualization of next generation sequencing (NGS) data is essential for interpreting
   high-throughput genomics experiment results. 'GenomicPlot' facilitates plotting of NGS data in
   various formats (bam, bed, wig and bigwig); both coverage and enrichment over input can be 
   computed and displayed with respect to genomic features (such as UTR, CDS, enhancer), and user
   defined genomic loci or regions. Statistical tests on signal intensity within user defined 
   regions of interest can be performed and represented as boxplots or bar graphs. Parallel 
   processing is used to speed up computation on multicore platforms. In addition to genomic plots
   which is suitable for displaying of coverage of genomic DNA (such as ChIPseq data),
   metagenomic (without introns) plots can also be made for RNAseq or CLIPseq data as well.
