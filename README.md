The goal of GenomicPlot is to create a efficient visualization tool for next generation sequencing data with rich functionality and flexibility. For some plots, statistical analysis is integrated and statistical plots like violin plots or Venn diagrams are generated simultaneously. Use of parallel computation in this package enables fast execution of tasks, allowing production of figures in less than 30 minutes in most cases on multi-core machines.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GenomicPlot from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shuye2009/GenomicPlot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to visualize your ChIP-seq peaks in different parts of genes:

``` r
library(GenomicPlot)
## basic example code
```
